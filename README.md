ubuntu-pentest-tools
====================

Script to install security tools, and other Ubuntu goodies.

**Currently at version : 1.1, supports 14.04 LTS. (Might not be entirely compatible with 13.10**

*Any suggestions to add more tools, or else, please don't hesitate to contact me.*
*Will be maintained to the best of my ability.*

*** a new release will come with the tools i have found interesting at Blackhat and Defcon this year. ***


**how to use this script:**

- chmod +x ubuntu-pentest-tools.sh then sudo ./ubuntu-pentest-tools.sh 

*Thanks to Beginthread, FrostLapin for testing.*
